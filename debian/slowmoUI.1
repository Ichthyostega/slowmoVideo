.SH NAME
slowmoUI \- create slow-motion videos from your footage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B slowmoUI
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B slowmoUI
commands.
.PP
\fBslowmoUI\fP is a program that creates slow-motion videos from your footage.
It does not simply make your videos play at 0.01 x speed. You can
smoothly slow down and speed up your footage, optionally with motion
blur.
.PP
How does slow motion work? slowmoVideo tries to find out where pixels
move in the video (this information is called Optical Flow), and then
uses this information to calculate the additional frames.
.PP
Videos in any format supported by ffmpeg can be loaded. Image sequences
can also be loaded, so, if you did a timelapse with too few frames,
slowmoVideo may help as well.
slowmoVideo does not work with a constant slowdown factor but with
curves that allow arbitrary time accelereation/deceleration/reversal.
Motion blur can be added, as much as you want.
